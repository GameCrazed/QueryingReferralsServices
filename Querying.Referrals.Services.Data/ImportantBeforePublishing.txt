1] Before any publish and in case you updated your entity models, do the following:

a] Search for public partial class LegalEntities : DbContext
b] make sure that the class contains the line: Configuration.ProxyCreationEnabled = false;
c] do the same for the rest of your contexts.

Example:
public LegalEntities()
            : base("name=LegalEntities")
        {
            Configuration.ProxyCreationEnabled = false;
        }
